For creating any Npm project:
create a folder with that projects name
terminal into dir:
1. npm init
##make sure "entry point" : app.js
2. npm install express #Note this is the framework that writes our site, basically we just fill in the blanks from here
3. write app.js with:
 var express = require("express");
 var app = express();

 app.get("/", function(req, res){
    res.send("This will be landing page soon!");
    });

//Required code for any of the above to work 
app.listen(3000,  function () {
    console.log('Webpage listening on port 3000, Time: ' + new Date());
});
